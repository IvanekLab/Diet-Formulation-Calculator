This study describes the oral administration of albendazole and fumagillin via a gel-based dietary vehicle in adult zebrafish infected with _Pseudoloma neurophilia_. 

Here we included an Excel spreadsheet that was created for this study to assist in the calculation of diet, drug, water, and clam juice (for palatability) volumes required to dose a given number of zebrafish at a given drug concentration and feeding rate. This editable tool may be used to assist other investigators that wish to create medicated feeds for fish species.
